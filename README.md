# Introduction
This is a collection of my Python solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) challenges, which I am going through retroactively to blow the dust off my coding skills. Advent of Code is an annual event, with a daily coding puzzle between December 1 - 25, usually of gradually increasing complexity. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to brush off their coding skills or learn a new language.

# Usage
The python scripts assumes that the corresponding input file is stored as `/AdventOfCode-Input/<year>/day<xx>.txt`, where that parent folder is placed alongside the folder for this repo.
