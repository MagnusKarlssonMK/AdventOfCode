# Introduction
This is a collection of my Python solutions with varying degrees of quality to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) challenges, which 
I have been going through retroactively to blow the dust off my coding skills. Advent of Code is an annual event, with 
a daily coding puzzle between December 1 - 25, usually of gradually increasing complexity. I highly recommend these 
challenges to anyone looking to improve their coding skills or learn a new language.

Note - If you don't know how to find the past years challenges, you can get there by clicking the 'Events' link on the
AoC page.

# Usage
The python scripts assumes that the corresponding input data is stored in a file with a file structure like 
`/AdventOfCode-Input/<year>/day<xx>.txt`, where that parent folder is placed alongside the folder for this repo.
