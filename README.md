# Introduction
This is a collection of my solutions to [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) challenges, which I am going through retroactively to blow the dust off my coding skills. Advent of Code is an annual event, with a daily coding puzzle between December 1 - 25, usually of gradually increasing complexity. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to brush off their coding skills or learn a new language.

I'm currently focusing on Python, but might expand to and convert the solutions to other languages later as a further learning experience. I might go back every now and then to revisit and improve the solutions little by little.

Note that since I'm doing these puzzles long after the fact, I'm not trying to go for speed to get on leaderboards or anything, i.e. I will usually rather take my sweet time and rather focus on making more clean and efficient solutions, which might not necessarily have been the best approach to reach the answer fast. For the most part, I also aim to try to stick to 'vanilla' python, as to not reduce the puzzles to just knowing which external package to import.

Also note that I'm an old C-programmer at heart, meaning that I desperately try to impose type control in a language that doesn't need it. So anyone who's more used to the gung-ho way of dealing with types in python may need to squint when looking at this.
